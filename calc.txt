#3 Introduction

Ever wanted to know how much damage units do to each other?  Or maybe you
didn't want to waste that fuel in fog of war just to see a 10%?  Then you can
use this guide to calculate your numbers in advance!

You can skip to certain parts by using the # and the digit listed in the
contents.  To get to Introduction, for instance, use #3.

#7 Calculation Rules

First, take the base damage of the attacking unit
Then, multiply in any modifiers based on COs, terrain, HP, and powers in use
Multiply them all separately, don't add them together and multiply once
The final number, after dropping the decimal, should be the number shown on
the attack

Examples:
Max attacks with a Tank against Kanbei's Mech unit on a mountain (4 stars)
Initial damage is 70
Max adds 20% (1.2) to the attack
Terrain reduces damage by 40% (0.6)
Kanbei reduces damage by 30% (0.7)
Multiply 70 x 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.7
Answer is 35.28, so the game should show 35%

If Max's Tank had 7 HP, and Kanbei's Mech had 4 HP, it changes a bit
Initial damage is still 70
7 HP means only 70% attack power (0.7)
Max still adds 20% (1.2)
Terrain now reduces damage by 16% (0.84) because of the Mech's 4 HP
Kanbei still reduces damage by 30% (0.7)
Multiply 70 x 0.7 x 1.2 x 0.84 x 0.7
Answer is 34.5744, so the game should show 34%

If they also use their super CO powers (Kanbei used his last turn, Max this
turn)
Initial damage 70
7 HP = 70% (0.7)
Max adds 60% (1.6) for using Max Blast
Terrain 4 HP x 4 stars is 16% (0.84)
Kanbei reduces by 60% (0.4) for using Samurai Spirit
Multiply 70 x 0.7 x 1.6 x 0.84 x 0.4
Answer is 26.3424 so the game should show 26%

Multiplication order isn't important, but you need to choose the correct
modifiers
Only Colin uses both his original modifier when he uses Power of Money
Others don't add their original modifier using Co or Super CO powers

#8 Random Notes

Sometimes the calculation is off by 1%, and I haven't figured out why yet.

Remember that this only calculates the percentage shown, not actual damage,
so using it to predict counter damage isn't always reliable.

Nell does more than the shown percentage sometimes, but I don't have any idea
how to calculate it.

Sonja does less damage than the shown percentage sometimes, unless she's using
Counter Break, but I don't know how to calculate it.

I have not extensively tested Colin's offense bonus with Power of Money, and
it may be WAY off for some numbers

I have not extensively tested Lash's defense bonus with Prime Tactics, because
it seems to be different for different HP values

Damage formula:
This is used to calculate the damage shown when attacking an enemy unit with your own unit.

( ( ( ( ( ( IA * BD ) * AN ) * ID ) * DN ) * AH) * (( 100 - TC * DH ) / 100) )

Note that the value inside each parenthesis must be rounded down.

IA = Attacking unit's inherent firepower
:::This will vary depending on the CO you use. For instance, Max's direct attacks are 50% stronger resulting in an IA of 1.5. On the other hand Grit has a 20% decrease in direct attacks and has an IA of 0.8. Values out of and during powers can be found in my CO FAQ. Note that some COs have an increase of their inherent firepower during power.:::

BD = Base damage
::: this is the damage percentage shown when IA, AN, ID, DN, AH and DH are worth 1 while TC is worth 0. It can be obtained by matching Andy with other Andy units, units being full health and being on terrain providing no terrain stars. The base of our calculation for which you can find the values in the Unit FAQ.:::

AN = Attacking unit's norm
:::As explained in my CO FAQ, out of power, all COs have a norm for defence and for offence of 1. However most COs will acquire a norm of 1.1 when attacking and a norm of 0.9 when defending. Exceptions are Sturm, Kanbei which both keep a norm of 1 and Eagle, whose norm is 0.8 when attacking and 1.3 when defending.:::

ID = Defending unit's inherent defence
:::This will vary depending on the COs in the same way as IA. Check the FAQ.:::

DN = Defending unit's norm
::: See AN explanation: 1 for all COs out of power, 1 for Sturm and Kanbei in Power, 1.3 for Eagle in Power and 0.9 for all the other COs.:::

AH = Attacking unit's HP
:::A unit has 10 HP when deployed and it isn't shown, however it will lose some in the course of battle and the HP left is displayed over the unit. Don't forget that the value AH is a fraction out of the maximum of HP: 10.:::

TC = Terrain cover
:::Over certain terrain, units can acquire defence. The efficiency of the increase in defence is displayed through stars. Each star represents a 10% decrease in damage taken. A 4 star terrain, like an HQ or a Mountain will thus have a TC value of 40. A 3 star terrain 30, etc.:::

DH = Defending unit's HP
:::However, the efficiency of the terrain cover is directly proportional to the HP of the defending unit. This is calculated in the same way as AH except the HP is taken off the defending unit.:::

For example:
Let's say I've got a 4 HP Max Tank (which still have primary weapon ammo) attacking during Power a 7 HP Kanbei recon which is also in Power mode and over a City.

IA is 1.70 as that is Max's inherent firepower in Power.
BD is 85 as the Tank still has ammo. Otherwise it would have been 40 as can be found in the unit guide.
AN is 1.1 as Max has a 1.1 norm in Power.
ID is 0.7 as Kanbei's defence decreases enemy attacks by 30% during Power.
DN is 1 as Kanbei has a 1 norm at all times.
AH is 0.4 as Max's Tank has got 4/10 HP.
TC is 30 as City provide 3 cover star.
DH is 0.7 as Kanbei's recon has 7 HP left.

1.7 * 85 rounded down = 144
144 * 1.1 rounded down = 158
158 * 0.7 rounded down = 110
110 * 1 rounded down = 110
110 * 0.4 rounded down = 44

Now for the terrain cover defence:
100 - 30 * 0.7 rounded down and divided by 100 = 0.79

44 * 0.79 rounded down 34%
This means that the Max Tank will display a 34% damage percentage when wanting to fire a Kanbei recon in the previous given conditions.

As you can see the formula is rather complicated and while I've not tested it out with every possible matchups and situations, I've built it from scrap from a couple of hypothesis and some testing which enabled me to find the right order in which the different values are ordered.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________


Damage Formula during counterattacks:
Some might have noticed that counterattacks are weaker than they should be. Seriously match up Max against Max, Recons against A-Air and you will notice a fair difference between the amount of damage predicted when you take first strike and the amount of damage done when counterattacking with the same unit. Especiallly when the battle conditions don't seem to have changed at all.

Well there is a difference and that difference lies in the health mechanics:
When we look at a unit we see a certain value determining it's health and used to calculate damage done when taking first strike. When we look at a unit in combat we notice a health bar which seems to fluctuate for the same HP. At the same time we notice that damage predicted isn't always the damage done. A 55% prediction can turn out to deal 5 or 6 HP damage.

When hacking AW2 we've been able to find random damage values and see the difference between when it was turned on or off and the results depending on its value.

Well simply put, this is my hypothesis: the health bar contains 100 parts for each decrease of 10 parts the unit shows a loss of 1 HP. Some have additionally noticed that a 55% damage usually resulted half the time in a 6 damage value and half the time in a 5 damage value. This is random damage. The damage prediction shows the actual minimal damage done and most COs have a random factor which can add up to 9% damage. This means that a 55% damage can result in 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64 damage done to the 100 health bar. As you can see, 5 of the values will result in 5 damage and the 5 other result in 6 damage, however, the unit countering will counter with its actual health. A unit countering with 5 HP but which has really taken 59% damage will have an AH of 0.41 instead of 0.5 which it would have had if it were taking first strike.

Note that some COs have special luck values. Sonja also has bad luck, and trusting her AW2 value, that means she has 2 random values to add to her damage: one is positive and can reach up to 9 and the other is negative and can also reach up to 9. This means that she'll randomly deal less damage than predicted at up to -9 of damage if she maxes her bad luck and minimizes her good luck. Nell on the other hand is lucky. She's used to dealing even greater amount of positive damage. +19 in AW2.

Additionally while bad luck didn't seem affected by anything, good luck was affected by the attacking unit's HP, and the opponent's defence. However, the damage formula has changed from AW to AW2 and while I'm sure luck is proportional to HP, I've yet to do testing with enemy defence.
